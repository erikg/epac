Erik's Partial Archive Collator
(C) 2002 Erik Greenwald <erik@smluc.org>

This program takes a directory as an argument, then walks through the
directory looking for duplicate and partially duplicate files. If it an exact
duplicate, it deletes one and creates a hardlink to the other, minimizing disk
usage. If it finds a pair of files where they contain the same data up to the
size of the smaller file, it will prompt if you want to combine them. If you
say yes, it will delete the smaller of the files and hardlink to the larger.

Installation:
	check the Makefile to see if everything is right for your system
	run "make" to build it
	strip and copy the binary into place. There is no automatic installer

Deinstallation:
	the only thing installed is the epac bin, so rm it

Bug reports:
	email erik@smluc.org
