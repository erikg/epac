# This program takes a directory as an argument, then walks through the
# directory looking for duplicate and partially duplicate files. If it
# an exact duplicate, it deletes one and creates a hardlink to the other,
# minimizing disk usage. If it finds a pair of files where they contain the
# same data up to the size of the smaller file, it will prompt if you want
# to combine them. If you say yes, it will delete the smaller of the files
# and hardlink to the larger.
