 * This program takes a directory as an argument, then walks through the     *
 * directory looking for duplicate and partially duplicate files. If it      *
 * an exact duplicate, it deletes one and creates a hardlink to the other,   *
 * minimizing disk usage. If it finds a pair of files where they contain the *
 * same data up to the size of the smaller file, it will prompt if you want  *
 * to combine them. If you say yes, it will delete the smaller of the files  *
 * and hardlink to the larger.                                               *
